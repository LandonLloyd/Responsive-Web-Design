        LeBron James came into the NBA right out of highschool. Many questioned
        if he had what it would take to make it in the big leagues. He proved
        that he did and dominated the NBA from the start. He has won three NBA
        championships and has appeared in 16 All-Star games. His journey to the
        NBA wasn't an easy one. LeBron was born in Akron, Ohio on December 30,
        1985. He was first introduced to basketball when he was three and got a
        little toy basketball hoop for Christmas. Instead of shooting a shot he
        ran and dunked the ball through the hoop. Growing up he moved to lots of
        different places. He sometimes even had to sleep on other peoples
        couches. During his childhood he was seen as a shy kid. He would ride
        his bike around Akron to stay out of trouble with gangs. One year he
        started living with his coach and attended every day of school. He
        excelled at playing basketball and it was obvious. By the time
        highschool came around everyone thought he would choose to go to the big
        Akron highschool. But instead he chose to go to St. Vincent St. Mary's
        highschool where he knew all of his friends would be able to play
        basketball with him. During highschool he also played football and was a
        star player. He was an All-American player and maybe could've gone on to
        play in the NFL. He quit football though because he was worried about
        getting injured and ruining his basketball dreams. After highschool was
        over he was the number 1 overall draft pick in the 2003 NBA draft class
        straight out of highschool! He was drafted to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
        His hometown team. He played with the Cavaliers for about 7 years and
        then left to the Miami Heat and won two NBA championships. Later in 2014
        he went back to the Cleveland Cavaliers and won a championship their. In
        2018 he left his hometown to go to the Los Angeles Lakers where he still
        plays today.
